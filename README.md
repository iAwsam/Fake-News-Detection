# Fake News Detection

## Project Overview

This project explores techniques for detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The goal is to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their textual content.

The documentation includes research on model selection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation methods. (Code development is planned in future versions.)

## Project Goals

- Understand how text classification works in fake news detection.
- Research common NLP techniques for data cleaning and feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings).
- Propose machine learning models suitable for this task (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.).
- Document findings and project architecture.

## Planned Tools

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, Matplotlib  
- **Platforms:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
